    "text": "I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Network Science Institute at the Roux Institute at Northeastern University. I received a Mathematical Sciences Ph.D. from the Vermont Complex Systems Center at the University of Vermont (UVM). While at UVM, I worked in the Joint Lab and Computational Story Lab. My research has mostly focused on network science applied to infectious diesase. This led me in the direction of mathematical methods for networks, specifically stochastic models that involve branching processes."
