    "text": "I am a fifth year Mathematical Sciences Ph.D. candidate in the Joint Lab and Computational Story Lab at the Vermont Complex Systems Center at the University of Vermont (UVM). My research has mostly focused on network science applied to biology. This led me in the direction of mathematical methods for networks, specifically stochastic models that involve branching processes.\nI am on the job market! Looking to explore industry positions. I am open to using my skill set on a wide variety of complex problems. Expected graduation date May 2024."
