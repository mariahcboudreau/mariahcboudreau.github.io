After graduating, I jumped right into my graduate studies at the University of Vermont in the Mathematical Science Ph.D. program and within the Vermont Complex Systems Center.\n\nWhen I am not at my laptop or reading papers, you can find me either in the mountains, where I am hiking or skiing, or at a Crossfit class."
