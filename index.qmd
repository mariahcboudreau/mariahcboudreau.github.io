I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Computational Medicine research group at the [Roux Institute at Northeastern University](https://roux.northeastern.edu/nu_research/comp-med/). I recently received a [Mathematical Sciences Ph.D.](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/mathstat) from the [Vermont Complex Systems Center at the University of Vermont (UVM)](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/). While at UVM, I worked in the [Joint Lab](https://joint-lab.github.io/) and [Computational Story Lab](https://compstorylab.org/). My research has mostly focused on network science applied to biology. This led me in the direction of mathematical methods for networks, specifically stochastic models that involve branching processes.
