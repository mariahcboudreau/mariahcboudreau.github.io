I am a fourth year [Mathematical Sciences Ph.D.](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/mathstat) student in the [Joint Lab](https://joint-lab.github.io/) and [Computational Story Lab](https://compstorylab.org/) at the [Vermont Complex Systems Center at the University of Vermont (UVM)](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/). My research has mostly focused on network science applied to biology. This led me in the direction of mathematical methods for networks, specifically stochastic models that involve branching processes. 

**I am on the job market!** Looking to exploring postdoctoral and industry positions. Expected graduation date May 2024.
